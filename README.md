1.      In the Control Panel, open the Add/Remove Programs applet (Programs on Vista) and uninstall Microsoft Silverlight if it is shown as installed by clicking on it and then clicking Uninstall or Remove. If you get an error on this step (for example a dialog saying that the .msi file cannot be found), just continue on to the next step

Note :Be careful that you only delete what I say to delete below. If you delete too much by accident it is quite likely that you will break something and there is no way to undo accidental changes
